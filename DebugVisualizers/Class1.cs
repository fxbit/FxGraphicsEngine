/* Visualizers are components of the Visual Studio debugger user interface.
 * A visualizer creates a dialog box or another interface to display a variable
 * or object in a manner that is appropriate to its data type. For example, 
 * an HTML visualizer interprets an HTML string and displays the result as 
 * it would appear in a browser window; a bitmap visualizer interprets a bitmap 
 * structure and displays the graphic it represents. Some visualizers enable you
 * to modify as well as view the data.
 * 
 * Copy the visualizer DLL to the remote computer before you start the debugging session.
 * 
 * The path to the DLL must be the same on both the remote and the local computers. 
 * This path can be either of the following locations:
 * 
 * Visual Studio install path\Common7\Packages\Debugger\Visualizers
 * or
 * My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Visualizers
 *
